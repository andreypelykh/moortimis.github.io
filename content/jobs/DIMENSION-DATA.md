This was my first role in what I considered the big time, after 6 years for working for small to medium size New Zealand based companies, this was my first experience working for a large multinational corporation. No longer supporting a single customer, this role saw me managing 300+ systems across many difference customers, which brought with it a number of challenges. Often being pulled in different direction, this role taught me that : Time management, team work, planning and agility were key factors to success.

## Achievements:
- Improve Managed Services delivery time lines by developing streamline automated procedures to handle customer request for new systems.
- Detail and Design Standard Operating Environments matching varying customer requirements for all Linux deployments
- Promotion from Linux Engineer based in Christchurch to Enterprise Unix consultant based in Auckland with a number of named accounts.
- Undertake due diligence and transition a high severity ESB application from AirNZ into operations
