Foodstuffs was my first appointment managing people, while I had taken on roles of leadership within teams like WML and project roles as in the council before, this was the first time that I had direct reports and the process that came with it. This was a new role within Foodstuffs and I was given the remit to implementing and control process across the organsiation. This included tasks such as implementing an Event Management application to asses change and outages quickly, through to tracking Key Performance Indicators for the company core systems. These process then feed directly into a change management policy that was first implemented during my time there and was the first step to help increasing the maturity of the organsiation.

# Achievements:
- Through monitoring and change awareness a reduction of 30% was seen in High Priority outages.
- Major Incident review procedures ensured proactive steps to understand and remediated the root case was taken causing a further reduction of 50% in High Priority outages.
- The growth in responsibility and process saw a need to expand the operations team and I was tasked with out sourcing the operations team and managing the relationship.
