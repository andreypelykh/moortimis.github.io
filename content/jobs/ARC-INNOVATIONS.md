Originally taken on a 6 month contract to conduct a review and replacement of Arc's aging EMC SAN Technology this role quickly expanded to include the implementation of vmwares first release of vCloud Director and the creation of a Service Orientated Architecture platform.

I took on this role at Arc Innovations to allow myself to gain a deeper understanding of technology and be involved for the first time in ground up solution deployment. From documenting customer use cases and requirements, through to high level design and architectural plans to the unboxing and raking new hardware. This, along with each of my roles as taught me that to be successful in this industry that you need to consider everyone in your design.

## Achievements:
- RFP Negotiations with Leading Hardware Manufactures to find the best fit for Arc's requirements.
- The architecture and deployment of distributed storage network to meet Arc Innovations availability and growth requirements.
- The architecture and deployment of VMware vCloud Director to streamline the development and testing procedures and alleviating operational bottlenecks.
