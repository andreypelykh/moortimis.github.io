The life of a consultant is not one for the faint hearted. Early morning starts and 14 hour days are common place. A role where you think on your feet and where “Always be prepared” was no longer the moto just for the scouts.
  
Due to my attention to detail and service delivery focus, I am often brought into pre-sales engagements to run compressed architecture and design workshops to discover and document requirements and assist with transitioning high level business requirements into effective designs and chargeable statements of work.
  
Red Hat has provided me with a broad set of tools to solve a wide array of problems.

## Achievements:
- Improve overall speed quality of customers experience through developing awareness and support for TOGAF methodologies and developing workshop material to assist in solution development.
- Being appointed to the ANZ Subject Matter Expect Team for Red Hat Cloud Orchestration and Identity Management portfolios.
- Support one of the worlds largest telecommunication companies to develop a costs effective and highly scalable cloud solution through the use of Red Hat technologies such cloudforms, openstack and automation technologies such as Puppet and Foreman.
